3. ***(Task3)*** **`Winning the game or run forever?`** It is up to our own design on whether we want the game to run forever till player loses or there is a winning stage/condition
4. ***(Task3)*** **`What is it meant by time elapsed? Need wave system?`** Not clearly stated in the document, design is up to us on how we want the game to be.
